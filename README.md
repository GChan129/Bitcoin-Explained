# Bitcoin-Explained
Milestone Project 1

Currently under construction.

This is my submission the first milestone project for Code Institute. It's meant to show my HMTL and CSS skills as well as my understanding of good design and use of media queries.

I designed this website to target mainstream netizens who have heard of Bitcoin but don't know what it is. This website is designed to give clear and correct information, as well as give links to valuable resources.
