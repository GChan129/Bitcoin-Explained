	        	<h2>Explaining Cryptocurrency</h2>
				<p>The main problem that I find most people have with understanding cryptocurrency is that they don't yet fully understand the current currency system which they're living with.
				So how can you know if cryptocurrency is really better than what we have now if we don't really understand what we have now? I like to explain it like this;</p>
				
				<p>  Two girls are chatting and one goes to the other, "You see that guy over there? Bitcoin. He's pretty amazing. I think you should give him a shot."</p>
				<p>Amy goes "I don't know. He's nerdy looking and young and I've been with HSBC for as long as I can remember. I don't want to leave him."</p>
				<p>Betty goes "Mmmmhmm. But remember that time in 2008 when you came home and saw that he gambled away all your savings and you couldn't go on holiday for two years because you had to pay off his debt?"</p>
				<p>"HSBC said they were sorry."</p>
				<p>"But what about a few years later when you found coke all over your dollar bills and found out he was laundering drug money?"</p>
				<p>"...They paid some of that money back."</p>
				<p>"Remember that time you wanted to donate to Wikileaks and they said, 'You're not allowed spend your money on that.' That's your money!"</p>
				<p>"That was only one time."</p>
				<p>"Or how about how they signed you up for all this extra stuff to get extra fees out of you but when you leave money with them, they barely have to pay you interest!"</p>
				<p>"I know the banking system is not perfect but we've been together a long time..... I don't think I can change."</p>
				<p>This is the author of this website now, talking to you the reader. Girl, you can do better! I honestly feel like regular people who are being abused by this 
				banking system just have lost hope of ever having a fair or honest financial system. Bitcoin isn't better because it's hip and fun. It's better because it's based on cold hard maths, which makes it fair.
				Think of embracing Bitcoin like having the good Terminator for your boyfriend. Not perfect, but better than lying ass HSBC / Wells Fargo / JP Morgan / Deuche Bank etc.</p>

				<p>Today in most ways, banks are still better than Bitcoin or most other cryptocurrencies. o far the technology and the infrastructure needs a few years before it's ready for everyone to use.

						<h3>The Future of Cryptocurrencies</h3>
						<p>Be careful with this one, because this will blow your mind. At least it blew my mind. </p>
						<p>When the internet was first developed, we couldn't have imagined how much it would change all of our lives.
						That version of the internet was just based on sending information and copies of things. This new version of the internet that 
						cryptocurrencies and the ability to send originals will create will be like the internet squared. What a time to be alive.</p>

		        		such that the transfer is guaranteed to be safe and secure, everyone knows that the transfer has taken place, and nobody can challenge the legitimacy of the transfer. The consequences of this breakthrough are hard to overstate."
